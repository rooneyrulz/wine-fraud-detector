# Wine Fraud Detector

## Overview

This repository is a dedicated space for learning and experimentation, focusing on the development of a Wine Fraud Detection Classifier. The project navigates through various stages of machine learning, including data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, model building, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, prediction, cross-validation, and grid-search.

## Key Features

### Data Analysis and Preprocessing

- Thorough exploration of the dataset using Pandas.
- Addressing missing values, handling outliers, and tackling imbalances in the data.

### Data Visualization

- Utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful visualizations.
- Analyzing feature distributions, class imbalances, and data patterns.

### Model Building

- Implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) using scikit-learn's `SVC`.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- Fine-tuning the SVM model through GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

### Model Evaluation

- Assessment of the model's performance on a separate test set.
- Utilizing metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### Cross-Validation

- Ensuring the model's generalization through cross-validation techniques.

### Prediction

- Making predictions on new, unseen data using the trained SVM model.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Library:** scikit-learn
- **Algorithm:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Note

This repository is created exclusively for educational purposes, providing hands-on experience in the end-to-end process of building a fraud detection model. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are encouraged.
